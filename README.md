# Rental-Price-Forecasting-Dashboard-for-Canada

## Overview
This project leverages a dataset of over 25,000 Canadian rental listings from June 2024 to predict rental prices and property sizes. It includes a web application built with Dash, allowing users to input their rental preferences and receive real-time predictions along with graphical insights into market trends.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data for analysis, adjusting columns and filtering unrealistic entries.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforms and encodes features for optimal model performance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning to train models on the processed data to predict rental prices and square footage.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Dash-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface for data interaction and visualization.
